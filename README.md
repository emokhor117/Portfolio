## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a frontend developer. The portfolio serves as a central place where recruiters, collaborators, and instructors can view my work, learn about me, and contact me easily.

The website is designed as a single-page application with smooth navigation between sections, a responsive layout, and a clean, modern user interface.
